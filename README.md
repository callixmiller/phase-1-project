# Rick and Morty Character Information

For my phase-1 project. I am creating a SPA that will display information about a character from the show Rick and Morty. There are a total of 826 characters to choose from on the site. The user will type and submit a number from 1 - 20 to pull up a card displaying information on a Rick and Morty character. The card will display an image of the character, their name, gender, status and species. 

The project uses JavaScript, with three different event listeners and one array iteration.
