# Rick and Morty Character Information

For my phase-1 project. I am creating a SPA that will display information about a character from the show Rick and Morty. There are a total of 20 characters to choose from on the site. The user will type and submit a number from 1 - 20 to pull up a card displaying information on a Rick and Morty character. The card will display an image of the character, their name, gender, status and species.

Below the character card section will host an ordered list of the 20 characters the user can call to the page. The ordered list will only display the character names. The list will allow the user to know which characters are available to be called to the page. The user will be able to click on a character name to change the font color to red. This functionality helps keep track of which characters have been called to the page.

The project uses JavaScript, with three different event listeners and one array iteration.
